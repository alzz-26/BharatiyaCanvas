# BharatiyaCanvas
This app was made as part of my university's project exhibition-1. 
Bharatiya Canvas aims to connect the rural artisans with their own artworks with all art enthusiasts who wish to learn the artworks, by providing paid video lectures. This app also features an unique AI model, trained specifically to predict our art practices. Logo - https://pin.it/1PJVgfF8S

# Technologies Used
1) App - Flutter
2) Authentication - Firebase
3) AI model - RESNET18
4) Backend - Python (hosted using Flask API)

# Progress So Far
We were able to train the dataset with accurate results and integrate it successfully in the app. Using firebase, sign-in/sign-up was set up and some basic pages were also made

# Learning Outcomes
1) Learned about various AI models and their accuracies
2) Learned about cleaning and fine-tuning the dataset
3) Learned about backend integration, APIs and various types of hosting
4) Learned about various uses of Firebase
